# Mega Helper Scripts

Scripts and methods to help you manage your [Mega](https://mega.nz) accounts.

This repo is designed and tested for use with macOS but will probably work just fine with Linux and likely work fine on Windows with WSL2. Maybe I will even test it on those platforms soon.

## Preparation

Install `megatools` ([homepage here](https://megatools.megous.com/), [old outdated repo here](https://github.com/MaxFork/MegaTools))

(macOS)

```bash
brew install megatools
```
