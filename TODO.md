- make it so that the final registered & verified new accounts list can get merged back into the "logins" list
  - this is difficult because I made the logins list ':' delimited for easier typing in Notepad, but the character ":" is included in the tokens and url (?) needed for verification so I had to use tab-delim for those files instead
  - maybe there is an easier file format to use? kinda afraid to introduce JSON or SQLite
- file chunking & uploading script
- script to see how many files, and how much free space, is on each account
- consider if we should instead try using Golang to write the scripts and helpers in... might be easier to do more complex actions, but tradeoff is that it will be harder to understand the source code and it will have to run the shell commands inside the program which is never fun
- see if we can incorporate the .megarc file
